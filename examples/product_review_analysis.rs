//! # Secretary - Product Review Analysis Example
//! 
//! This example demonstrates how to use the Secretary library to analyze product reviews
//! and extract structured information such as sentiment, key points, and recommendations.
//!
//! ## What This Example Shows
//!
//! This example demonstrates:
//! 1. Creating a schema for product review analysis
//! 2. Extracting multiple fields of different types (strings, arrays, enums)
//! 3. Using the extracted data to generate insights
//!
//! ## Environment Variables
//!
//! Before running this example, set:
//! - `SECRETARY_OPENAI_API_BASE`: Your OpenAI API base URL
//! - `SECRETARY_OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key 
//! - `SECRETARY_OPENAI_MODEL`: The model to use (e.g., "gpt-4o-mini")
//!
//! ```bash
//! export SECRETARY_OPENAI_API_BASE="https://api.openai.com/v1"
//! export SECRETARY_OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
//! export SECRETARY_OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"
//! cargo run --example product_review_analysis
//! ```

However, I find the new gesture navigation confusing and the price is a bit high for what you get. I'd recommend waiting for a sale, but overall it's a solid device. Would probably buy from this company again.",
        
        "Terrible experience with this blender. It worked fine for the first week, then started making a loud noise. The build quality is cheap and the warranty process is a nightmare. The only positive is that it looks nice on the counter. Save your money and buy something better. I regret this purchase completely.",
        
        "This desk chair is just okay. The cushioning is comfortable and it has good lumbar support, but the armrests are wobbly and the height adjustment keeps sinking throughout the day. Assembly was straightforward, taking about 30 minutes. For the price, it's decent, but I wish I had spent a bit more for better quality. If they improved the hydraulics and armrests, it would be a great chair."
